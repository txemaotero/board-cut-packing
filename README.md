# First approach

Implement the algorithm described [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360835207000678?via%3Dihub)
- The algorithm will be implemented in C++ to optimize and parallelize it as
  much as possible
- Bindings will be implemented to create a UI


## TODO

- [X] Have a working version in a single `cpp` file
- [ ] Parallelize the code (try using `<execution>`) and std algorithms
- [ ] Restructure the code in cpp modules
- [ ] Introduce cross platform building with cmake
- [ ] Define python bindings
- [ ] Implemente a simple web app using streamlit
